# Flight Price Prediction

This repository contains a machine learning project focused on predicting flight ticket prices based on various flight features. The project involves data integration, preprocessing, and model training.

## Repository Structure

- `Datasets/` – Raw and transformed datasets used for model development.
- `Data Integration.ipynb` – Notebook for data loading, cleaning, and feature engineering.
- `Modelling.ipynb` – Notebook for training and evaluating machine learning models.

## Project Overview

- **Goal**: Predict the flight ticket prices based on features such as airline, source, destination, duration, number of stops, and more.
- **Dataset Source**:  
  - Kaggle Dataset: [Flight Price Prediction](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/shubhambathwal/flight-price-prediction/data)  
  - Web-Scraped Data: Extracted using **Octoparse** from *Ease My Trip*, an online flight booking platform.
